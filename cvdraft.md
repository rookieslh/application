##Research Experience

###Xiaolan Zhang Lab
Apr.2013-present  **Undergraduate Research Intern**

- Currently working with PhD candidate Li Jiang on the function validation of Cucumber( *Cucumis sativus* L.) FRUITFULL (CsFUL) gene

- Obtain the clone of the *Arabidopsis* FRUITFULL (FUL) promoter and conduct  ectopic CsFUL expression in *Arabidopsis* with pAtSUP::CsFUL and 35S::CsFUL system

- Perform subcellular localization of CsFUl1/2 gene using Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP)

- Construct vectors for yeast double hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in order to clarify the interactions between CsFUL1/2 genes and other important genes involved in floral patterning and fruit development of cucumber

- Synthesis of cDNA from different organs of transgenic cucumber plants and use Real time Quantitative PCR (q-RT PCR) to elucidate the expression pattern of CsFUL1/2 gene in cucumber


- Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of FUL-like genes



###Lusheng Zhang Lab
May 2013-March 2014 **Undergraduate Research Program (URP) of CAB,CAU**


- Project: Influence of excessive nitrogen stress on continuous-cropping strawberries (*Fragaria ananassa*) 

- Main author of the project concluding report and the sole presenter of project oral defense

- Continuous cropping soil environment simulation and excessive nitrogen gardient treatment

- Conduct assay of diverse parameters of photosynthesis using portable photosynthesis system

- Perform assay of POD and PPO enzyme (two major enzymes with close relationship with systemic acquired resistance of plants) activity.

- Investigate the occurance and severity of common strawberry diseases
